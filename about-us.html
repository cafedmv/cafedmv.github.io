                        <p>Sean Thomas Augustine’s journey into the world of art has not been linear. Born in
                            Washington DC, at a young age his family moved from Alexandria, VA to the suburb of
                            Fredericksburg, VA. From there he trained in vocal development from a young age at the
                            private parochial St. Patrick School in Spotsylvania county. First graduating class of
                            Riverbend High, Sean practiced creative writing, poetry and attended ukulele club.
                            Graduating cum laude with an associates degree in liberal arts from Germanna Community
                            college, Sean practiced and developed a passion for journalism at this time and when not
                            studying developed an interest in the realms of human consciousness and potential.</p>
                            <p>From 2013-2019 Sean would go on to become an elevator mechanic, as was the daily trade,
                            third in line of family lineage.
                            His apprenticeship was a prosperous time of learning and development in a broad range of
                            skills such as welding and steel construction, complex mechanical, hydraulic and electrical
                            systems, troubleshooting and maintenance work. All of these skills and more now apply
                            directly in his skills as his first sculpture consisted of completely recycled bicycle components
                            bolted and welded together and fuel his love for industrial art. Sean also volunteered to help
                            to paint a mural in Alexandria in 2022 for community development and crime prevention.</p>
                            <p>He is currently training in trauma informed breathwork facilitaton and mindfulness practition.
                            Current projects consist of solstice themed canvas visual &amp; sacred ballet. He also hosts
                            multiple songwriting groups a week for budding songwriters and artists.</p>
